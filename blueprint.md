# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure, design, and features of a modern, responsive landing page.

## Current State

The project is a simple HTML page with a heading and a button.

## Plan

1.  **HTML Structure:**
    *   Create a header with a navigation bar.
    *   Add a hero section with a title, subtitle, and a call-to-action button.
    *   Add a section with three feature cards, each containing a placeholder image and a description.
    *   Create a footer with social media links.
2.  **Styling (style.css):**
    *   Use a light color palette with soft, rounded shapes.
    *   Implement a responsive layout using flexbox or grid.
    *   Style the header, navigation, hero section, feature cards, and footer.
    *   Use CSS variables for colors and fonts for easy customization.
    *   Add subtle shadows and transitions for a modern look.
3.  **JavaScript (main.js):**
    *   Create a custom element for the feature cards to demonstrate Web Components.
    *   Add smooth scrolling for navigation links.
