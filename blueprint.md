# VR Architecture Portfolio

## Overview

This project is a virtual reality architecture portfolio designed to showcase architectural designs in an immersive 3D environment. The application is built using modern web technologies, including React for the user interface and Three.js for the VR experience.

## Design and Features

### Landing Page

*   **Layout:** A clean, modern, and responsive design featuring a full-screen layout.
*   **Header:** A prominent headline introducing the featured project (e.g., "Modern Villa").
*   **Image Gallery:** A grid of high-quality images showcasing the architectural design.
*   **Call to Action:** A clear and compelling button that invites users to "Enter VR Tour."
*   **Footer:** A simple footer with copyright information.

### Styling

*   **Framework:** Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling.
*   **Color Palette:** A sophisticated and modern color scheme with a dark background (`bg-gray-900`) and white text.
*   **Typography:** A clean and readable font with a large, bold headline.
*   **Interactivity:** The "Enter VR Tour" button has a hover effect that changes its color and size to provide visual feedback.

### VR Tour

*   This feature is not yet implemented.

## Current Plan

*   The immediate next step is to build the VR tour functionality. This will involve:
    *   Integrating the Three.js library for 3D rendering.
    *   Creating a 3D scene with a camera and renderer.
    *   Loading a 3D model of the architectural design.
    *   Implementing controls for navigating the VR environment.
